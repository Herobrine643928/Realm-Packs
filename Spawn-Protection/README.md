# Spawn Protection

This pack allows for the use of tags in safezones to stop players from dealing damage, placing blocks, and mining blocks.
No experimental toggles are needed for this pack to work!

# Configuration
The tag to give players to prevent damage to players & the environment is `safezone`. This can be changed in the `player.json` file, as well as the `index.js` file.
Note that this pack will *not* work with other packs that use `player.json` in them.

If you have questions, please ask me!
