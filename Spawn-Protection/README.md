# Spawn Protection

This pack allows for the use of tags in safezones to stop players from dealing damage.

# Configuration
The tag to give players to prevent damage is `safezone`.
Note that this pack will *not* work with other packs that use `player.json` in them.

If you have questions, please ask me!
