# Custom Kill & Death Messages

This pack allows the user to create custom kill and death messages for their players.
No experimental toggles are needed for this pack to work!

# Configuration
The constants `defaultDeathMsg` & `defaultKillMsg` are the default messages that will be used if no custom one is found on the player.

# Setup
This pack uses player tags for custom messages, so the pack can be used with command blocks!
Kill message tags must start with `Kill:`.
Death message tags must start with `Death:`.
To insert the dead player's name into one of these tags, put `DP` into the tag. 
To insert the killer's name into the tag, put `KP` into the tag.
If you wish to use DP or KP in the tag without it being replaced with the names, simply put a `!` in front- `!DP` or `!KP`, for instance.

Feel free to use whatever colour codes and ASCII symbols you want to jazz up the messages!

If you have questions, please ask me!
